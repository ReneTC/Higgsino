title: Tides explained with simulations
date: 2019-11-03
description2: Simulating why there are 2 tidal bulges. The differential gravity causes what seems to be to bulges of water on both sides of the earth. Why? A better explanation is to see these bulges as vector forces. In this video i explain why. I'm also explaining why there aren't tides in lakes. All showed with simulations showing newtons gravitational equation. It all depends on the distance squared.
