title: The Physics of superconductors
date: 2018-12-03
description2: How a superconductor works. Everything from the physics and some of the history as well. Superconductors were discovered in 1911 by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes. It was discovered because it was made possible to liquefy helium which produced temperatures down to 2-4 kelvin. It was then discovered the resistance drops to 0 after the critical temperature. It is explained by BCS theory, how two electrons goes from fermions and bonds into a boson. This theory can be used to levitates trains or everything. Explained by the meissner effect. This video only cover type 1 and not type 2 superconductors.
