date: 2017-07-13
description2: 4 physicists show and explain their favourite physics-related image. First  Parth G   talks about scanning tunnelling microscope, tunnelling current and the resulting images. Then  Andrew Dotson  shows how bubble champers can detect different particles. Next  Pretty Much Physics  explains what Feynman diagrams are, and how they help with calculations. Lastly  @iggsino physics  demonstrates Snell's window and how you can see it in a swimming pool.
