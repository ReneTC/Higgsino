date: 2018-06-28
description2: The speed of light and black holes. What happens when at the speed of light? What about a black hole? This video explains how time dilation works with very fast relativistic speeds. The equation and the intuition behind the logic. We cover some of Albert Einstein relativistic physics theory.
