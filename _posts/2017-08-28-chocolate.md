description2: How does the hot chocolate effect work? The weird pitch frequency coming for your coffee. The speed of sound changes when water and a powder mixes. Air is created and slowly fly out of the system. But air changes the bulk modulus and that changes the speed. The frequency depends on the speed of propagation in a fluid. Animated and explained. An extremely cool physical phenomena.
