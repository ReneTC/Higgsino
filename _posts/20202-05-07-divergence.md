title: The divergence operator and Gauss's law
date: 2017-07-13
description2: On the divergence field In Gauss law The  operator that works on a vector field. A normal explanation of the divergence operator, is saying that it measures how much is flowing in or out in a given area. In this video we will take a more mathematical approach to see what the divergence means. For electric fields all  fields have divergence zero. Everywhere on the field we are measure how much is flowing in or out. In vector calculus, divergence is a vector operator that operates on a vector field, producing a scalar field giving the quantity of the vector field's source at each point. But where we have charge the divergence equals the density of the charges. We can use that to make a Gaussian surface and with that, integrate and find the electric field We do that by finding a matching Gaussian surface in that have a special symmetry.
