title: The actual reason why matter expands when heated - Thermal expansion
date: 2017-07-13
description2: A physics animation about why matter expands when heated. Thermal expansion is happens because of the morse potential. When heated (adding more kinetic energy in the molecules) The molecules have on average a bigger molecule. Buy why? The potential energy between neighboring atoms are not symmetric takes more energy to compress the spring, than it takes to stretch. (Animated physics video)
