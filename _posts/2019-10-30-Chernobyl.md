description2: Radiation and fallout in Hiroshima vs in the Chernobyl accident. . Hiroshima and Chernobyl both suffered a major atomic disaster, where radioactive atoms was released. Hiroshima was nuked by the uranium fissile atomic bomb, little boy with energies of 15 kilotons of TNT. Chernobyl's uranium fissile reactors produced 3,200 MW (megawatts) of thermal power, used Uranium and the reactor also blew up but due to extreme steam pressure. Why can you then live in one, but not the other? We will cover How and atomic bomb works. How a nuclear reactor works. Detonation type in the air, and in the ground. Reaction mechanism fissioning of U235. And lastly waste products; Iodine, Cesium Irradiated graphite moderators. All these things combined are why the Chernobyl was much worse in terms of radiation.
