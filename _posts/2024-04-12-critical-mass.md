title: Critical Mass Misconception - Atomic Bombs and Nuclear Reactors Simulated
date: 2017-07-13
description2: Atomic bombs and nuclear reactors explained. With simulation. Also explaining why critical mass is a confusing topic in nuclear physics. It depends on a lot more than just the mass. I'm also using simulations, to show you these reasons as well as how a nuclear reactor work, and how an atomic bomb work. The critical mass depends on Mass, Purity, Geometry, Density, Neutron Initiator, Tamper,  Neutron Deflector and more
