title: Entropy explained - Why heat only flows from hot to cold
date: 2018-11-24
description2: Entropy explained with simulations. Intuitively understand entropy. Why Heat only flows one direction. Physics lecture with simulations of the system. The reason is because of statistics and more specifically multiplicity. We will explore how particles follow a Boltzmann distribution. Furthermore, we will discover entropy is not disorder! Multiplicity is a relation of a microstate and a macrostate. And multiply tend to increase and so does entropy since it is defined only as a function of multiplicity. So now we can understand why heat only flows one direction. It is simply too improbable for heat to flow from cold to hot.
