title: Does Quantum Mechanics Apply to Large Objects?
date: 2019-12-27
description2: Why Quantum mechanics applies to more than just the smallest particles. And how quantum mehcnaics converges to the classical limit depending on the de brogile wavelength. We explore the double slit experiment and discover bucky balls actually shows super position or quantum interference.
